# SLEPc uses the portable makefile system provided by the PETSc library.  
# The following include files set customized site, optimization, and version
# options.  Do NOT remove any of these include files!  You should generally
# need to edit only ${SLEPC_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/packages to specify the
# packages installed in your system.

include ${SLEPC_DIR}/bmake/slepc_common_variables

include ${SLEPC_DIR}/bmake/slepc_common_rules
