 Overview
 --------

 SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations, is a software
 package for  the  solution of large sparse  eigenvalue  problems  on  parallel
 computers. It  can be used for the solution of problems formulated  in  either
 standard  or  generalized form, as well as other related problems such as  the
 singular value decomposition.

 The  emphasis  of the software is on methods and  techniques  appropriate  for
 problems  in  which  the  associated matrices are sparse, for  example,  those
 arising after the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore,
 most  of  the methods offered by the library are projection methods  or  other
 methods  with similar properties. Some of these methods are  Arnoldi,  Lanczos
 and Subspace Iteration, to name a few. SLEPc implements these basic methods as
 well  as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support  for
 spectral transformations such as shift-and-invert.

 SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and genralized
 eigenvalue  problems,  both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either  real  or
 complex arithmetic.

 SLEPc is built on top of PETSc, the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
 Computation (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc). It can be considered an  extension
 of  PETSc  providing  all the functionality  necessary  for  the  solution  of
 eigenvalue  problems.  This means that PETSc must be previously  installed  in
 order  to  use SLEPc. PETSc users will find SLEPc very easy to use,  since  it
 enforces the same programming paradigm. For those users which are not familiar
 with  PETSc yet, our recommendation is to fully understand its basic  concepts
 before proceeding with SLEPc.


 Documentation
 -------------

 The  Users Manual is included in the SLEPc distribution file. It can be  found
 in directory  'docs' and it contains a general description of the capabilities
 of  the software.  The manual does not include detailed reference  information
 about  individual SLEPc routines. This information is provided in the form  of
 man pages in HTML format (see 'docs/manual.htm'). 


 Installation
 ------------

 The installation procedure of SLEPc is very similar to that of PETSc. Briefly,
 the  environment variable $SLEPC_DIR must be set, then the script configure.py
 is executed and finally the  libraries  are built with the command 'make'. For
 this to work correctly, variable $PETSC_DIR must also be set appropriately.

 More detailed information about installation can be found in the Users  Manual
 or in the SLEPc home page, including instructions for configuring SLEPc to use
 external libraries such as ARPACK.
