		  classes of parallel machines, especially these with
		  distributed memory. Although there are many variations, the
		  basic concept of processes communicating through messages
		  is well understood. Over the last ten years, substantial
		  progress has been made in casting significant applications
		  in this paradigm. Each vendor has implemented its own
		  variant. More recently, several systems have demonstrated
		  that a message-passing system can be efficiently and
		  portably implemented. A definition of both the syntax and
		  semantics of a core of library routines is thus presented.
		  It will be useful to a wide range of users and efficiently
		  implementable on a wide range of computers.",
