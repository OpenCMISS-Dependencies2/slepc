This document describes slepc4py_, a Python_ port to the SLEPc_
libraries.

SLEPc_ is a software package for the parallel solution of large-scale
eigenvalue problems. It can be used for computing eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of large, sparse matrices, or matrix pairs, and also for
computing singular values and vectors of a rectangular matrix.

SLEPc_ relies on PETSc_ for basic functionality such as the
representation of matrices and vectors, and the solution of linear
systems of equations. Thus, slepc4py_ must be used together with its
companion petsc4py_.
