:Abstract:
	       This document describes slepc4py, a Python_ port to the 
	       SLEPc_ libraries. 
	       SLEPc is a software package for the parallel solution
	       of large-scale eigenvalue problems. It can be used for
	       computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large, sparse
	       matrices, or matrix pairs, and also for computing singular
	       values and vectors of a rectangular matrix.
	       SLEPc relies on PETSc_ for basic functionality such as the
	       representation of matrices and vectors, and the solution 
	       of linear systems of equations. Thus, slepc4py must be
	       used together with its companion petsc4py_.
