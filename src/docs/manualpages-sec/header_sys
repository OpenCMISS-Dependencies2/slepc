<h2>SLEPc System routines</h2>

SLEPc provides a variety of "system" level routines. These routines are generally tools used by other SLEPc routines and are not intended for application programmers.

Useful tools for application programmers can be found in PETSc's system routines, including parallel file access, synchronized printing to screen.
