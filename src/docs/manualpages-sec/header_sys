<h2>SLEPc System routines</h2>

<p>SLEPc provides a variety of "system" level routines. These routines are generally tools used by other SLEPc routines and are not intended for application programmers (except the basic <a href="SlepcInitialize.html">SlepcInitialize</a>() / <a href="SlepcFinalize.html">SlepcFinalize</a>()). 
</p>
<p>
Useful tools for application programmers can be found in PETSc's system routines, including parallel file access, synchronized printing to screen, and many other programming aids.
