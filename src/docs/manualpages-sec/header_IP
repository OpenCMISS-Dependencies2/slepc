<h2>Inner Product - IP</h2>

<p>
The IP package provides auxiliary routines that are internally used by the different SLEPc solvers. It provides an abstraction of a vector inner product that can be defined in different ways, and it includes important operations such as Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
</p>
<p>
These routines are usually not needed by application programmers.
